# Python Example

The Python example is available on [Github](https://github.com/MakarenaLabs/MuseBox-client-examples/tree/main/Python).

There are 3 example:

- a python script (`musebox_client.py`) that implements a MuseBox client based on zmq communication (like the C++ example)

- a python script (`musebox_client.py`) that implements a MuseBox client based on websocket communication (like the C++ example)

- a jupyter notebook script (`client.ipynb`) that implements a MuseBox client based on zmq communication
